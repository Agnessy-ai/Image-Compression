# Image-Compression

🖼️ Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Image-Compression is a Python-based interactive tool that demonstrates how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to compress images while preserving visual quality. Designed for learners, researchers, and developers, this app helps visualize how mathematical techniques like SVD reduce data dimensionality and file size effectively.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Interactive SVD Compression: Select image rank (k) to control the level of compression and visual quality.

📉 Compression Ratio Insights: Compare original and compressed image sizes and ranks.

🧠 Visual Learning Tool: See the effect of each singular value component on image reconstruction in real-time.

🧮 SSIM Metric Comparison: Evaluate image similarity using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

🌡️ Heatmap Visualization: (Optional Extension) Visualize areas of high or low structural similarity between original and compressed images.

📤 Export Results: Download compressed images for use or analysis.
